This component allows you to evaluate the air quality in any room, using data from various sensors installed there. Such as temperature, humidity, carbon dioxide sensors, etc.

The index is calculating in accordance with the [IAQ UK organization methodology](IAQ_Rating_Index.pdf).

I also suggest you [visit the support topic][forum] on the community forum.

## Installation

### Install from HACS (recommended)

1. Have [HACS][hacs] installed, this will allow you to easily manage and track updates.
1. Search for "Indoor Air Quality UK Index".
1. Click Install below the found integration.

... then if you want to use `configuration.yaml` to configure sensor...
1. Add `iaquk` sensor to your `configuration.yaml` file. See configuration examples below.
1. Restart Home Assistant

### Manual installation

1. Using the tool of choice open the directory (folder) for your HA configuration (where you find `configuration.yaml`).
1. If you do not have a `custom_components` directory (folder) there, you need to create it.
1. In the `custom_components` directory (folder) create a new folder called `iaquk`.
1. Download file `iaquk.zip` from the [latest release section][releases-latest] in this repository.
1. Extract _all_ files from this archive you downloaded in the directory (folder) you created.

... then if you want to use `configuration.yaml` to configure sensor...
1. Add `iaquk` sensor to your `configuration.yaml` file. See configuration examples below.
1. Restart Home Assistant

### Configuration Examples

To use this component in your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
iaquk:
  kitchen:
    sources:
      temperature: sensor.kitchen_temperature
      humidity: sensor.kitchen_humidity
      co2: sensor.kitchen_eco2
      tvoc: sensor.kitchen_tvoc
    sensors:
      - iaq_level

  livingroom:
    name: "Living Room"
    sources:
      hcho: sensor.livingroom_formaldehyde
      pm:
        - sensor.livingroom_pm25
        - sensor.livingroom_pm10
```

### Configuration variables

Each room in the settings is defined by its own named group of parameters. You can specify the friendly name of this group (room), the sensors involved in the calculations, and which sensors you need to create for the output.

You can create as many groups as you need. But each group must have an unique name.

**name**:\
  _(string) (Optional) (Default value: deslugified group name)_\
  Friendly name to use in the frontend.

**sources**:\
  _(dictionary) (Required)_\
  Dictionary of sensors involved in the calculations. At least one sensor must be specified.

> **temperature**:\
> _(string) (Optional)_\
> Room temperature sensor entity ID.\
> Required sensor's unit of measurement: °C or °F
>
> **humidity**:\
> _(string) (Optional)_\
> Room humidity sensor entity ID.\
> Required sensor's unit of measurement: %
>
> **co2**:\
> _(string) (Optional)_\
> Room Carbon Dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) sensor entity ID.\
> Required sensor's unit of measurement: ppm, ppb, mg/m<sup>3</sup> or µg/m<sup>3</sup>
>
> **co**:\
> _(string) (Optional)_\
> Room Carbon Monoxide (CO) sensor entity ID.\
> Required sensor's unit of measurement: ppm, ppb, mg/m<sup>3</sup> or µg/m<sup>3</sup>
>
> **no2**:\
> _(string) (Optional)_\
> Room Nitrogen Dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>) sensor entity ID.\
> Required sensor's unit of measurement: ppm, ppb, mg/m<sup>3</sup> or µg/m<sup>3</sup>
>
> **tvoc**:\
> _(string) (Optional)_\
> Room tVOC sensor entity ID.\
> Required sensor's unit of measurement: ppm, ppb, mg/m<sup>3</sup> or µg/m<sup>3</sup>
>
> **hcho**:\
> _(string) (Optional)_\
> Room Formaldehyde (HCHO; CH<sub>2</sub>O) sensor entity ID.\
> Required sensor's unit of measurement: ppm, ppb, mg/m<sup>3</sup> or µg/m<sup>3</sup>
>
> **radon**:\
> _(string) (Optional)_\
> Room Radon (Rn) sensor entity ID.\
> Required sensor's unit of measurement: Bq/m<sup>3</sup>
>
> **pm**:\
> _(string | list) (Optional)_\
> Room particulate matter sensors entity IDs.\
> Required sensor's unit of measurement: mg/m<sup>3</sup> or µg/m<sup>3</sup>

**sensors**:\
  _(list) (Optional) (Default value: all sensors below)_\
  List of sensors  you need to create for the output. The following sensors can be added:

> **iaq_index**:\
> The sensor displays the air quality in numerical form from 1 to 65. The higher the value, the better the air quality.
>
> **iaq_level**:\
> The sensor shows the air quality in a human-readable form. Possible values: Excellent, Good, Fair, Poor, Inadequate.

**_Note_**:\
The icon of `iaq_level` sensor changes its image depending on the value of the sensor.

## Track updates

You can automatically track new versions of this component and update it by [HACS][hacs].

## Troubleshooting

To enable debug logs use this configuration:
```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
logger:
  default: info
  logs:
    custom_components.iaquk: debug
```
... then restart HA.
